# OPTIMI Memory Lab — Overview

> One-page summary for collaborators and contributors

---

## What

Personal research lab exploring **long-term memory for AI agents**.

## Why

AI tools don't remember context. Every request starts fresh. I research how to fix this.

## How

8 layers of context intelligence:

| Layer | What it captures |
|-------|------------------|
| Code | Structure, complexity, patterns |
| Git | History, churn, authorship |
| Memory | Past refactorings, outcomes |
| Dependencies | Imports, blast radius |
| Tests | Coverage, flaky tests, gaps |
| Runtime | Logs, errors, performance |
| Health | Project trends, predictions |
| Team | Preferences, review patterns |

## Research Focus

1. **Memory architectures** — Mem0, A-MEM, custom solutions
2. **Context aggregation** — How to fuse 8 layers effectively
3. **Multi-agent memory** — Shared vs private patterns
4. **Evaluation** — Benchmarks beyond LOCOMO

## Current State (Jan 2026)

- 📚 Completed LLM Memory Survey (30+ sources)
- 🏗️ Designed 8-layer architecture
- 🧪 Experiment backlog ready
- 🚀 Starting first experiments
