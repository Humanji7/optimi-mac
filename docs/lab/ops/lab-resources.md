## Sustainability

- **Now:** Self-funded from personal budget
- **Future Options:**
  - GitHub Sponsors
  - Consulting/workshops
  - Research grants
  - Patreon/Substack paid

---

## Cost Optimization

- Batch embedding calls
- Cache embeddings locally
- Use `text-embedding-3-small` (cheaper)
- Limit experiment scope
