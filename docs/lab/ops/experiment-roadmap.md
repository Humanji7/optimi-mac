# 🗺️ Experiment Roadmap

> Research timeline — success = learning, not shipping

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal:** Set up lab infrastructure, run first experiment

- [ ] Set up Chroma DB locally
- [ ] Configure embedding pipeline (OpenAI)
- [ ] Create memory-service wrapper
- [ ] **Experiment E001:** Mem0 vs Chroma comparison
- [ ] Document baseline metrics

**Deliverable:** First experiment report

---

## Phase 2: Core Research (Weeks 5-12)

**Goal:** Context layer experiments, first publication

- [ ] Implement Layers 1-3 (Code, Git, Memory)
- [ ] **Experiment E002:** 5-layer vs 8-layer quality
- [ ] **Experiment E003:** Custom dev benchmark
- [ ] Write first blog post: "What I Learned About LLM Memory"
- [ ] Publish experiment code to GitHub

**Deliverable:** 2 experiment reports, 1 blog post, 1 OSS release

---

## Phase 3: Synthesis (Weeks 13-20)

**Goal:** Build reference implementation, write guide

- [ ] Implement remaining layers (4-5)
- [ ] **Experiment E004:** A-MEM evaluation
- [ ] Build working prototype with memory
- [ ] Write comprehensive guide: "Building AI with Memory"
- [ ] Open source the reference implementation

**Deliverable:** Working prototype, comprehensive guide, OSS tool

---

## Phase 4: Advanced (Weeks 21+)

**Goal:** Multi-agent, advanced topics

- [ ] **Experiment E005:** Multi-agent memory sharing
- [ ] Explore Layers 6-8 (Runtime, Health, Team)
- [ ] Consider arXiv paper if novel findings
