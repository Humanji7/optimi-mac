## What is Living Memory?

A practical system for **learning from AI collaboration failures**:

1. **Log errors** when something goes wrong with Claude, Cursor, or any AI agent
2. **Find patterns** — same mistakes repeat across projects
3. **Build memory** — create rules and prompts that prevent repetition
4. **Evolve** — the system grows with your experience

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Cadence |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Error entries | 10+ | /month |
| Patterns discovered | 3+ | /month |
| Prevention rules created | 1+ | /week |
