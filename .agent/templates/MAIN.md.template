## 🪝 GUPP: Guaranteed Uninterrupted Progress

### FIRST ACTION — Always:
```bash
cat .agent/HOOK.md 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **ACTIVE 🔴** | Execute CURRENT molecule. No new work. |
| **IDLE ⚪** | Free to accept new tasks. |
| **Not found** | Work normally with rules below. |

---

## 📏 Thresholds

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Task > 3 files | `/decompose` first → create HOOK.md |
| 10+ tool calls | Consider `/handoff` |
| 5+ files changed | Commit immediately |

---

## 🔄 /handoff Protocol

When approaching context limit:

1. **Commit**: `git commit -m "WIP: [molecule] - handoff"`
2. **Update HOOK.md**: Mark progress, add Handoff Note
3. **Report to user**: ✅ Done / 🔴 Current / ⚪ Pending

---

## 🚫 Never

- ❌ Ignore existing HOOK.md  
- ❌ Edit 5+ files without commit  
- ❌ Skip handoff when limit approaching  
- ❌ Delete HOOK.md without archiving

---

## 🗣️ Commands

| User says | Agent does |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Продолжи" / "Continue" | Read HOOK.md, execute CURRENT |
| "Статус" / "Status" | Show convoy progress |
| "/handoff" | Save and prepare transfer |
| "/decompose: X" | Create HOOK.md for task X |
